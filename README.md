## About The Project

PurpleRain is a cute hyper rainbow ðŸŒˆ web page that I made back in 2017 while I was bored at work at my old receptionnist job.
I tried creating some interesting perspective effects by using 3D coordinates for the raindrops.
Also, if you wait long enough, you will see some random lightning.

The code could definitely have some improvements. This was coded when I was a young learning programmer.
